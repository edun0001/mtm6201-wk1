        My name is Olaitan Boluwatife Edun. I am 18 years old. I was born on June 8<sup>th</sup>, 2004. A lot of things matter to Me but the main thing that matters to me more than anything else is family.
        I know this is too general but I put nothing before family. My family is everything to me.One of my greatest fears is no doubt failure. Failure is one of many things I have been afraid of since I was little. I do try to tackle it by thinking the positive but then I don’t know why I just find it so hard. I picture myself getting a good grade but the time flies, I start imagining myself looking at a paper with numerous Fs. It has become a problem for me in specific areas. A common area is tests. No matter how hard I study, I can’t help it thinking the first thing I will see is an F in the color red. It is so bad I think of dropping out. 
        To achieve my goal of becoming the next Stan Lee in the future, I have to acquire the skills of professionalism that he had. Stan Lee was a man of incredible imagination, he had an image of a man with spider powers. He was laughed at and made fun of because of that but Spider-Man still became one of the most recognized and popular characters today. It first starts with imagination. In life, I want to be known and remembered as the black Stan Lee. One thing I am passionate about is graphic design. 
        I want to design and have copyrights for my characters.  Some characters I have already pictured are The Hurrikane, Hacksaw Storm, Lighting McPrince, Kid Thunderstruck, Olaitan ZAXEL, The Middleman, Zombiekillers, and other characters who are still in early development.
